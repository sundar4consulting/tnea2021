# Dynamic Agent Orchestrator for Form Intent Discovery

## Architecture Overview

The orchestrator needs to:
1. Monitor Elasticsearch for new forms
2. Analyze form structure and content
3. Extract potential intents dynamically
4. Update routing logic
5. Register new handlers


Form Discovery: Every 60 seconds, scans Elasticsearch for new forms
Intent Extraction: When a new form is found, LLM analyzes the schema and generates appropriate intents
Dynamic Registration: New intents are automatically registered with routing logic
Query Processing: User queries are matched against dynamic intents and routed to the right forms
Status Management: Tracks submission status and provides real-time updates
